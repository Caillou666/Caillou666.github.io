				<h1>Class Rules</h1>
			<h2>Government Classes</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>In the PD, the Mayor has final say on building defenses. If they waive this right, then it is passed on to the Police Chief.</li>
					<li>The mayor cannot set laws that allow for rule violations or hinder role-play (including any law that restricts building).</li>
					<li>The mayor may not run for the next mayor vote if they have switched jobs mid-term.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Police Specific Rules</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Police must arrest instead of kill after giving a valid 10 second warning</li>
					<li>Police may be asked to leave the inside of a base and/or stop impeding a door/exit legally and without risk to the opposite party of arrest, else they risk fair demotion.</li>
					<li>Police must only want/warrant an individual off of definite and visible infractions. One exception includes advertisements displaying explicit hit and/or printers.</li>
					<li>Police must grant individuals clear warnings in chat during lockdowns.</li>
					<li>Police may arrest people past the PD lobby or KOS them if they are armed with hostile intent.</li>
					<li> may resort to KOS if a seemingly harmless wanted criminal takes out weaponry after being wanted.</li>
					<li>Police may only build checkpoints if authorized by the Mayor.</li>
					<li>Police may not place illegal items inside a base to arrest or warrant them.</li>
					<li>Police may only raid with a warrant.</li>
					<li>Police cannot raid with criminals.</li>
					<li>IF a player is wanted, the police must make every attempt to arrest FIRST, unless they are armed with hostile intent. Do not confuse this with the police absolutely having to acknowledge crime, they have every right to be corrupt and ignore it.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Grounds for demotion include</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Violating custom laws. However, they can be immune to laws and hierarchy whenever they may prohibit them from performing their duties.</li>
					<li>Setting laws that give special treatment to a particular person or group</li>
					<li>Receiving payment for law changes</li>
					<li>Refusing to enforce the laws</li>

				<ul>
					<li>DJ’s may not place their radio within the vicinity of another already-established radio.</li>

				</ul>
			<h2>Meth Cook</h2>
				<li>NOT governed by the RDM rules.</li>
				<li>May not be RP related to anyone except fellow meth cooks.</li>
			<h2>Vendors</h2>
				<li>Do not scam. "Vendoring" encompasses all trade and transactions, even while not being a vendor job, done via (PM), (YELL), and (CHAT). Also, this holds no relation to "Gambling", something that users should be utilizing through functions already found on the server (Gambling Machines). If you are scammed after free hand gambling with other players on the server without utilizing the gambling machines, or you are scammed via transactions not found in non-global chats (ADVERT), you are completely on your own.</li>
